Question
========

`r question[[Q]]`

**First six rows of the data frame:**
```{r, echo = FALSE}
dat %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = catagory, values_from = value) %>% 
  select(-id) %>% 
  head() %>% 
  kable()
```

Use the box plot below to determine if the data meets the homogeneity of variance assumption. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "hide", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 6, fig.path = "", fig.cap = ""}
dat %>% ggplot(aes(x=catagory,y=value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(), #remove x axis labels
        axis.title.y=element_blank()  #remove y axis ticks
        )
```

Answerlist
----------
* The variance of the data appears to be the same across groups; thus, the data meets the homogeneity of variance assumption.
* The variance of the data appears to be different across groups; thus, the data meets the homogeneity of variance assumption.
* The variance of the data appears to be the same across groups; thus, the data does not meet the homogeneity of variance assumption.
* The variance of the data appears to be different across groups; thus, the data does not meet the homogeneity of variance assumption.
