Question
========

`r q.text[[Q]]`

**Table A**

`r kable(q.data)`

**Table B**
`r kable(q.distrobution)`

Use the following output to evaluate weather the sample (Table B) fits the population distribution (Table A) at the `r sig.level` level of significance.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
test.out
```

Answerlist
----------
* Reject the null hypothesis, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the sample (Table B) does not fit the population distribution (Table A)
* Fail to reject the null hypothesis, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the sample (Table B) does not fit the population distribution (Table A)
* Reject the null hypothesis, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the sample (Table B) does not fit the population distribution (Table A)
* Fail to reject the null hypothesis, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the sample (Table B) does not fit the population distribution (Table A)
