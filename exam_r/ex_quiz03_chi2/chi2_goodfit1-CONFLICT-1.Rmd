Question
========

`r q.text[[Q]]`

**Table A**

`r kable(q.data)`

**Table B**
`r kable(q.distrobution)`

Use the R window below:

```{r,echo=FALSE,results='asis'}
paste0("observed <- c(", 
        paste(observed,collapse =", "),
       ")\n",
       "expected <- c(", 
        paste(round(expected,4),collapse =", "),
       ")"
      ) %>% rdrr.io()
```
