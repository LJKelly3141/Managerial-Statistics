Question
========

`r q.text[[Q]]`

`r kable(q.data)`

Use the following output to evaluate weather the above random process is fair at the `r sig.level` level of significance.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
test.out
```

Answerlist
----------
* Reject the null hypothesis, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the process is unfair
* Fail to reject the null hypothesis, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the process is unfair
