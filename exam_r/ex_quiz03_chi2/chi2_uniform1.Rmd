Question
========

A call center receives calls through out week. The following is day of the week for a random sample of phone calls.

`r kable(q.data)`

Use the R window below:

```{r,echo=FALSE,results='asis'}
paste0("observed <- c(", 
        paste(observed,collapse =", "),
       ")"
      ) %>% rdrr.io()
```
