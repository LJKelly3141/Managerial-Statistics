Letter grades will be assigned based on your performance in these case studies:

|     |                 |     |     |                 |
|-----|----------------:|-----|-----|----------------:|
| A   | 93.50% or above |     | C   | 72.50% - 77.49% |
| A-  | 89.50% - 93.49% |     | C-  | 69.50% - 72.49% |
| B+  | 87.50% - 89.49% |     | D+  | 67.50% - 69.49% |
| B   | 82.50% - 87.49% |     | D   | 59.50% - 67.49% |

# Use of Generative AI

Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, are permissible for helping you complete tasks that you are capable of performing independently without aid. However, it is not permissible to use a generative AI model to perform actions that you are not currently capable of carrying out without assistance. Additionally, you are responsible for verifying the validity of any results or information generated by AI tools. Misuse of AI to complete tasks beyond your current abilities or to bypass critical thinking and understanding is not allowed.

# Major Assignments and Examinations

- **Final Presentation:** You will be required to present one of your case studies at the end of the semester. The presentation will be recorded and evaluated as part of your final grade.
